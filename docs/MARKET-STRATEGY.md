## 7. Regulatory Considerations

### 7.1 Legal Compliance Requirements

| Regulation | Requirement | Strategy |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **UU ITE (No. 19/2016)** | Electronic transactions & information | Full compliance, data protection |
| **UU PDP (No. 27/2022)** | Personal Data Protection | Encryption, consent management, DPO appointment |
| **Permenkominfo 5/2020** | Electronic System Registration (PSE) | Register with Kominfo |
| **UU Advokat (No. 18/2003)** | Regulation of legal practice | Clearly state: AI is legal information, NOT legal advice |
| **OJK Regulations** | If involving financial services | Payment compliance via licensed gateway |
| **PP 71/2019** | Electronic System & Transaction | Data localization requirements |

### 7.2 Critical Legal Positioning

> ⚠️ **AI Lawyer is a LEGAL INFORMATION and DOCUMENT AUTOMATION platform, NOT a law firm.**
> 
> We do NOT provide legal advice. We provide:
> 1. Legal information and education
> 2. Document templates and generation tools
> 3. Connection to licensed lawyers for actual legal advice
> 
> This positioning follows the DoNotPay model and is critical for regulatory compliance.

### 7.3 Data Localization

Per PP 71/2019 and UU PDP, personal data of Indonesian citizens must be:
- Stored in data centers within Indonesia (or with adequate protection)
- Protected with encryption at rest and in transit
- Subject to consent management and right to deletion
- Reported to BSSN in case of data breach (within 3x24 hours)

**Our Strategy:** Use Azure Indonesia region (Southeast Asia) for primary data storage + backup.
